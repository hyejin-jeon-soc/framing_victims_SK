## Abstract
This study investigates the framing of sex-based crime reporting in Korean media from January 2002 to June 2018 by employing text mining algorithms. A total of 106,346 articles collected from ten media outlets were analyzed using Structural Topic Modeling and word embedding. The research reveals a positive trend in attitudes towards reporting on sexual crimes since 2012, with a reduction in sensationalistic descriptions and personal narratives of both victims and offenders. This shift is attributed to the implementation of guidelines for reporting on sexual crimes. However, the media's portrayal of offenders and victims still demonstrates divergent approaches, particularly towards female victims, perpetuating social discrimination and bias. The findings contribute to understanding societal attitudes and norms surrounding sexual harassment and violence in Korea and shed light on the media's role in shaping these perceptions.

## DATA
We collected sexual crime related articles published from January 1, 2002 to June 15, 2018 on the official website of ten media outlets, including seven print media and three broadcasting companies. Researchers collected articles containing the keywords 'rape,' 'sexual harassment,' 'sexual assault,' 'sexual misconduct,' 'sexual crime,' and 'sexual violence' by utilizing the official websites of the respective media outlets. However, for MBC (Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation), news search related to these keywords was not available, so I used a news search on a portal site to collect their articles. As for SBS(Seoul Broadcasting System), they do not provide news articles prior to 2011 on their official website, so I collected articles using a news search on the same portal site. The total number of articles collected during the process was 156,000 but after excluding duplicate articles and those not directly related to sexual crimes, a total of 106,346 articles remained. The number of articles analyzed for each media outlet is as follows
