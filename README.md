# framing_victims_SK

This study investigates the framing of sex-based crime reporting in Korean media from January 2002 to June 2018 by employing text mining algorithms. A total of 106,346 articles collected from ten media outlets were analyzed using Structural Topic Modeling and word embedding. The research reveals a positive trend in attitudes towards reporting on sexual crimes since 2012, with a reduction in sensationalistic descriptions and personal narratives of both victims and offenders. This shift is attributed to the implementation of guidelines for reporting on sexual crimes. However, the media's portrayal of offenders and victims still demonstrates divergent approaches, particularly towards female victims, perpetuating social discrimination and bias. The findings contribute to understanding societal attitudes and norms surrounding sexual harassment and violence in Korea and shed light on the media's role in shaping these perceptions.
